## Research on Identifying Risk Factors for Excessive Alcohol Consumption: Analysis of 2013 BRFSS Survey Data
### Introduction:
In the United States, excessive alcohol consumption poses a significant public health concern due to its link with various negative health outcomes such as liver disease, cancer, and injuries.

This project aims to find potential risk factors or variables that could be targeted for intervention to reduce excessive alcohol use. To do so, data from the 2013 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey will be used, with logistic and Poisson regression used to model the probability, frequency, and intensity of alcohol consumption.

The dataset includes response variables measuring the frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption, and explanatory variables such as physical and mental health status, sleep duration, marital status, education level, household income, and sex. The most significant explanatory variables for each model will be identified, and the limitations and strengths of the models discussed, with recommendations provided for future research. By understanding the factors associated with alcohol consumption, effective interventions can be developed to reduce excessive alcohol use and its negative health outcomes
