## Research on Identifying Risk Factors for Excessive Alcohol Consumption: Analysis of 2013 BRFSS Survey Data
In the United States, excessive alcohol consumption poses a significant public health concern due to its link with various negative health outcomes such as liver disease, cancer, and injuries.

This project aims to find potential risk factors or variables that could be targeted for intervention to reduce excessive alcohol use. To do so, data from the 2013 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey will be used, with logistic and Poisson regression used to model the probability, frequency, and intensity of alcohol consumption.

The dataset includes response variables measuring the frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption, and explanatory variables such as physical and mental health status, sleep duration, marital status, education level, household income, and sex. The most significant explanatory variables for each model will be identified, and the limitations and strengths of the models discussed, with recommendations provided for future research. By understanding the factors associated with alcohol consumption, effective interventions can be developed to reduce excessive alcohol use and its negative health outcomes

## Dental Clinic Scheduling & Revenue Optimization
In this group project, we proposed dental scheduling and revenue optimization for a clinic called PacificWest Dental Group. We provided optimized solutions to maximize the revenue in a regular week based on the clinic's availability and demands. The report includes two optimization solutions: one is to minimize the doctors’ weekly salary pay to minimize the labor cost. Based on that, another optimal solution is to maximize the weekly revenue by generating a schedule of the provided treatment by each doctor on each working day.
The report consists of five parts: 
● Background information about the clinic, detailed staff data, and optimized problems. 
● Process of model construction for two main problems, including choosing variables, setting hard and soft constraints, and building the mathematical objective formulas.
● Optimization results generation using Gurobi and explanation of the results. 
● Discussion and Recommendations to the clinic based on the results.
● Summary and future plan for improvement.

## Tobacco Consumption with Educational Background as Allocation Base
With the broader applications of data science in the business area, business is not pure business anymore. Business analytics nowadays always requires the combination of data analytics and strategic decision-making. Our topic will focus on tobacco consumption with the education background of the consumers as the allocation base. Based on the data collected, a fair recommendation can be reached for the client, US Tobacco Associate.
