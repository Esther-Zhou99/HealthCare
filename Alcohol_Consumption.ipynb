        "I have calculated the VIF for the model, the result shows that the VIF values for marital, menthlth&marital, marital&sex, and menthlth&marital&sex are high. One of the main issues with multicollinearity involving the marital variable is that it can make it more difficult to identify the unique contribution of this variable to the response variable, separate from the effects of other correlated explanatory variables in the model. This is because the marital variable is involved in several interaction terms with other variables in your model, which can make it difficult to isolate its specific effect on the response variable. For example, the interaction term menthlth:marital suggests that the effect of mental health on the response variable may depend on marital status, but it is unclear how much of this effect is due to the menthlth variable alone, the marital variable alone, or the interaction between the two. Similarly, the interaction term marital:sex suggests that the effect of marital status on the response variable may depend on gender, but it is unclear how much of this effect is due to the marital variable alone, the sex variable alone, or the interaction between the two. In addition, the high VIF value for marital suggests that there may be significant multicollinearity between this variable and other explanatory variables in your model. This can make it difficult to interpret the coefficients for all of the variables in your model, as they may be influenced by the presence of correlated variables. In particular, the high VIF value for menthlth:marital suggests that the effect of mental health on the response variable may be difficult to disentangle from the effect of marital status, since these variables are highly correlated with each other.\n",

Lastly, we have minimized AIC and deviance/df by testing different models, ensuring that our model is better-fitting.\n",

To improve the logistic model, we could include additional explanatory variables that are known to be associated with alcohol consumption.\n",

Although there are some collinearities casue by the factor \"Marital\", we have addressed this issue through creating interaction term.\n",

        "There are two limitation about this model. First, the response variable does not follow a poisson distribution, so using poisson regression model may not be able to accurately fit the data and make prediction. Secondly, the alcohol consumption may not merely related to these eight factors. Therefore, more data might need to be collected such as age, religion, job status, and drinking history, and since we are only able to include four factors in the model, it would somehow limit the descriptive and predictive power of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve the model, first, we should be able to use other type of models such as multiple regression models. Then, if possible, include more factors that could affect alcohol consumption such as age, religion, job status, and drinking history. Finally, include more explanatory variables in the model so that it can take more factors into consideration and predict more accurately."
